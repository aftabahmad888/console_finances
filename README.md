# console_finances
This is Financial analysis tool.

## Overview

I have created the financial analysing tool by writing the  code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have written this code by using the dataset provided in this `starter/index.js` file.

## Instructions and completion of tasks:

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.
### I have Create a new GitHub repo called `console_finances`. Then, cloned it to my computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.
### I have copied the starter files in my local git repository.



3. Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
### I have written the code in index.js file, which shows the total of months in console of browser.
![code can be seen below for the total count of months](./images/Total_Months.jpg)


* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
###  I have written the code in index.js file, which shows the total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period in which can be seen in console of browser.
![code can be seen below for the total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period](./images/Net_profit_lose.jpg)



* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average. (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`
### I have written the code in index.js file, which shows verage of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period which can be seen in console of browser.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
### I have written the code in index.js file, which shows the greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period which can be seen in console of browser.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
### I have written the code in index.js file, which shows the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period which can be seen in console of browser.
![code can be seen below for the decrease of amount and it's date](./images/decrease_of_profit_lose.jpg)




4. When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
### My final code shows the same results.
